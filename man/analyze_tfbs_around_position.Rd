\description{
This function takes a BED file with TFBS, a BAM file with an aligned sequence and a TXT file with the normalized
local coverage values for CNA, and outputs the corrected mean depth coverage values around TFBS, as well as
generates a pdf with a plot for them. For better understanding check: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12714-4
