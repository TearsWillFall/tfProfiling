\arguments{
\item{bin_path}{Path to binary. Default tools/samtools/samtools}

\item{bed}{Path to BED file with regions.}

\item{bam}{Path to BAM file.}

\item{norm_log2}{Local segment log2}

\item{mean_cov}{Mean genome wide coverage.}

\item{mapq}{Min quality of mapping reads. Default 0}

\item{method}{Method to use to estimate coverage. default/binned}

\item{start_bin}{Downstream distance from genomic position to limit bin size of central region. Only if binned mode is selected.}

\item{end_bin}{Upstream distance from genomic position to limit bin size of central region. Only if binned mode is selected.}

\item{score}{Score to measure. ACC/MR}

\item{bin_width}{Bin size to bin methylation data in default mode}
}
\value{
A DATA.FRAME with per base coverage por each genomic position
}
\description{
This function takes chromosome location, as well as strand information, and generates a coverage report around
for it. This coverage can be normalized if local segmentation values for the region are given and further corrected by the
the local coverage in the BAM
}
